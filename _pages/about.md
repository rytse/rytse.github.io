I'm a research engineer at [Matic](https://maticrobots.com/), where I work on problems relating to optimization and visual SLAM. At the same time, I'm finishing my master's thesis on representation learning for reinforcement learning at the University of Maryland, where I'm fortunate to be advised by [Professor Kaiqin Zhang](https://kzhang66.github.io/). I'm curious about symmetry and optimization, and I try to use these tools to make robots smarter.

## Projects

Aside from my job, my recent work has been in discovering and exploiting symmetries in deep learning models. Right now I have one paper under review and another in progress regarding this topic. While the code for these papers isn't out yet, I've open sourced some related libraries, including [torchemlp](https://github.com/rytse/torchemlp), [geonets](https://github.com/rytse/geonets), and [camoc](https://github.com/rytse/camoc-multiagent).

A while back, I started [blair3sat](https://www.blair3sat.com/), an academic team designing a CubeSat to measure ionospheric charge density. The project fizzled out in 2021, but recently I've been helping some students start it back up again.
