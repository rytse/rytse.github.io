I like building things and learning math. Most of my interests revolve around signal processing and control, though I'm also interested in physics, "economics," and analytic philosophy. Also, I really like space. We should go there more often.

## Building Things

Currently I work part time at [Nuro](https://nuro.ai/), a self-driving delivery vehicle startup, where I work on designing, implementing, and testing radar DSP algorithms. In 2017, I founded [blair3sat](https://www.blair3sat.com/), a team working on building a CubeSat to map ionospheric charge density in-situ. I now mentor the team on the design and validation of the HF receiver and advise team leadership on executive strategy and funding. A more complete list of all the stuff I've worked on can be found [here](https://rytse.github.io/cv/).

## Learning Math

Stuff I'm currently studying:
 * Geometric control
 * Variational methods
 * Various differential geometry tidbits
 * "Mechanism design"

Stuff I'll be studying soon:
 * Algebraic topology (for real this time!)
 * Quantum physics

## Other Stuff I Do

Outside of my "productive" interests, I also like rock climbing (mostly bouldering) and backpacking, and I've recently started writing blog-ish content. Maybe some day that content will live on this website.
