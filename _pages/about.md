I like building things and learning stuff. Most of my interests revolve around control theory, machine learning, and signal processing, but I'm also interested in physics and "economics."

## Building Things

I have ~3 research projects currently in the pipeline, a few related to my masters program and a few that I'm doing on my own. Papers coming soon!

I'm an incoming research engineer at [Matician](https://matician.com/), an indoor robotics startup. I used to be a radar signal processing engineer at [Nuro](https://nuro.ai/), a self-driving delivery vehicle startup. A while ago I founded [blair3sat](https://www.blair3sat.com/), an acadaemic team building a CubeSat to map ionospheric charge density in-situ.

## Learning Stuff

Stuff I'm currently studying:
 * Stochastic processes
 * Diffusion models
 * Geometric machine learning
 * Algebraic topology

Stuff I'll be studying soon:
 * Plasma physics
 * Quantum physics

## Other Stuff I Do

Outside of my "productive" interests, I also like rock climbing (mostly bouldering) and backpacking. If you live in the Bay Area and want to get coffee, talk about math, or climb rocks with me, feel free to DM me on Twitter or email me at 𝔯𝔶𝔞𝔫𝔱𝔰𝔢100@𝔤𝔪𝔞𝔦𝔩.𝔠𝔬𝔪.
