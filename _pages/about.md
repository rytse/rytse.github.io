I like building things and learning stuff. My research interests mostly revolve around control theory and signal processing, but I'm also interested in physics, "economics," and analytic philosophy. So far I've mostly focused on space applications, but recently I've pivoted my research towards biological applications.

## Building Things

I'm currently working on a project that has applications in microbots. It's currently in stealth-mode, but this will hopefully change in the coming months. If by some freak chance you're reading my website, do microbot research, and want to work with me, contact me! I'm actively looking for domain experts to collaborate with. My email address is rytse[at]umd\<dot\>edu.

Previously I've worked at [Nuro](https://nuro.ai/), a self-driving delivery vehicle startup, where I designed, implemented, and tested radar DSP algorithms. In 2017, I founded [blair3sat](https://www.blair3sat.com/), a team working on building a CubeSat to map ionospheric charge density in-situ. I now mentor the team on the design and validation of the HF receiver and advise team leadership on executive strategy and funding. A more complete list of all the stuff I've worked on can be found [here](https://rytse.github.io/cv/).

## Learning Stuff

Stuff I'm currently studying:
 * Algebraic topology
 * Variational methods
 * Lie algebra stuff 

Stuff I'll be studying soon (these aren't really math):
 * Biohybrid swimmers
 * Quantum physics

## Other Stuff I Do

Outside of my "productive" interests, I also like rock climbing (mostly bouldering) and backpacking, and I've recently started writing blog-ish content. Maybe some day that content will live on this website.
