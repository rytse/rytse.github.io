I'm a freshman at the [University of Maryland, College Park](https://umd.edu/) studying Electrical Engineering and Applied Math. I like working on control systems and modeling things. I'm also an Eagle Scout from [Troop 1449](https://rockville1449.mytroop.us). Check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/rytse) and my [résumé](Resume.pdf).

# Work Experience

Last summer I interned at [Intelligent Automation Incorperated (IAI)](https://www.i-a-i.com/), analyzing quantization error in [bursty OSTBC-CPM](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/abstract/document/1578339) receiver and designing Kalman filters for sensor fusion for an indoor positioning system. Before that, I interned at the [Naval Research Laboratory (NRL)](https://www.nrl.navy.mil/) twice, first at the [Laboratory for Autonomous Systems Research (LASR)](https://www.nrl.navy.mil/lasr/) where I researched deep learning-based approaches to vehicle trilateration, and then at the [Spacecraft Engineering Department (SED)](https://www.nrl.navy.mil/sed/) where I developed an efficient bursty satellite ranging protocol.

# blair3sat

I founded a CubeSat team at my high school. We're an entirely student-run team working to build and fly a small satellite to measure characteristics of the ionosphere.

Our satellite has two science objectives. Our primary mission is to take ionospheric charge density measurements from space. We will receive ground-based ionospheric radar soundings and perform low power space-based soundings. This data would complement ground-to-ground soundings and would be applied to radio propagation models to improve HF communications and OTH radar tech. Our secondary mission is to detect high energy particles' photon emissions in the ionosphere. This data would contribute to basic research in geomagnetics and the study of how the magnetosphere interacts with solar radiation.

More details available on our [website](https://www.blair3sat.com/).

# Oracle of Blair

My high school political statistics class made a predictive model for the 2018 U.S. House election. Check out our model [here](https://polistat.mbhs.edu/). Check out the demographics preprocessor, written by me, [here](https://github.com/rytse/blairvoyance).

# Hackathons

I like hackathons! So far I've been to:

* HackMIT 2019  
* Bitcamp 2019
* HackUMBC 2016
