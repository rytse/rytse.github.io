I'm a rising senior at [Montgomery Blair High School](https://mbhs.edu/departments/magnet/). I
like working on control systems and modeling things. I'm also a Life Scout in
[Troop 1449](https://rockville1449.mytroop.us). Check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/rytse)
and my [résumé](res/Resume.pdf).

# Blair CubeSat Project

I'm starting a CubeSat team at my highschool. Details coming soon!

# MBHS Systems

I'm a member of MBHS Systems, a new Blair team that takes on hard real-world modeling problems.
This year we are working on a global pollen model, trying to predict pollen concentration based
on satellite imagery of regions' ecological and geographical features. Most of my work has been
on efficiently representing pollen emissions and how pollen plumes move.

We've just begun implementing our model. You can check out our progress
[here](https://github.com/mbhs-systems).
