I'm a senior at [Montgomery Blair High School](https://mbhs.edu/departments/magnet/). I
like working on control systems and modeling things. I'm also an Eagle Scout in
[Troop 1449](https://rockville1449.mytroop.us). Check out my [GitHub](https://github.com/rytse)
and my [résumé](res/Resume.pdf).

# blair3sat

I lead a CubeSat team at my highschool. We’re an entirely student-run team working to build and fly a small satellite to measure characteristics of the ionosphere.

Our satellite has two science objectives. Our primary mission is to take ionospheric charge density measurements from space. We will receive ground-based ionospheric radar soundings and perform low power space-based soundings. This data would complement ground-to-ground soundings and would be applied to radio propagation models to improve HF communications and OTH radar tech. Our secondary mission is to detect high energy particles' photon emissions in the ionosphere. This data would contribute to basic research in geomagnetics and the study of how the magnetosphere interacts with solar radiation.

More details available on our [website](https://www.blair3sat.com/).

# MBHS Systems

I'm a member of MBHS Systems, a new Blair team that takes on hard real-world modeling problems. This year we are working on a global atmospheric dispersion model, trying to predict how particles such as pollen or pollutants move through the air. Most of my work has been on efficiently representing distributions of these particles and how these distributions evolve due to weather effects.

We've just begun implementing our model. You can check out our progress
[here](https://github.com/mbhs-systems).

# Oracle of Blair

My political statistics class made a predictive model for the 2018 U.S. House election. Check out our model [here](https://polistat.mbhs.edu/). Check out the demographics preprocessor, written by me, [here](https://github.com/rytse/blairvoyance).
